# Conversational AI ChatBot for University ü§ñ

An intent-based conversational Chatbot specially for University related queries powered by a Small Language Model (SLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
The system intelligently classifies user queries, routes them to the right response generator, and delivers accurate, context-aware answers.

# Features

- Intent Classification ‚Äì Uses a lightweight transformer model (T5-small) to detect user intent.

- Dual Response System:

     - Direct response from SLM for simple intents.

     - RAG pipeline (Gemini Pro + Sentence BERT embeddings + ChromaDB) for knowledge-grounded answers.

- Scalable & Modular ‚Äì Easy to extend with new intents, knowledge sources, or APIs.

- Open-Source Friendly ‚Äì Built using Hugging Face models, ChromaDB, and Python.
